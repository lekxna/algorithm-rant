# algorithm-rant
This isnt like a code this is just a rant.so theres trading model tutorial i saw on the internet and thought it could be improve so heres my rant

when i was watching the tutorial on the trading algorithm i thought to my self why dont these people(qauntatative analyst
instead of solely calculating the multiple indicators(and present them with algorithms) and causing there brain to be fudged
they instead created a neural network which would be more efficient and trained it. i was watching a  algorithm trading course
and all the guy did was calculate the volatility i thought they were gonna you neural netwrok techniques but instead they didnt
and if they used all the indicators as inputs including data presented by the qaunt reaserchers like the size of the land and the
oil sent inputed those values by programming a simple if statement used relu and trained this algorithm for a couple months using the stock markets movement as the true database we will literally have an automatic qaunt which is insane to me

i posted this cus i wanted to see the opinons of proffesionals ... im not a qaunt myself however i thought this idea may have been
pretty good since i saw the tutorial not inplememnting it
